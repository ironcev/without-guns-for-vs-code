# Smoke Tests

This folder contains sample source files that are used in smoke tests. There is a single file per programming language or file type.

Each file is a compilation of real-life source code taken from different open source projects. The projects from which the code has been taken are listed on the top of the file.

The goal was to create realistic compilations that cover most of the features of the particular programming language or file type. The examples will grow over time.
